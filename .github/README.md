# mechgroupbuys API wrapper

This is a *updated* wrapper of https://mechgroupbuys.com, programmed to be far more efficient than [my previous attempt](https://github.com/louismeunier/mechgroupbuys-api). Rather than using a webscraper, which proved to be incredibly slow, I used a proxy to find the address of the mechgroupbuy server (https://mechgroupsbuys.com/gb-data). This repository simply wraps this all-encompasing endpoint and separates the result JSON in to categories based on product type and time available.

*I am not associated with www.mechgroupbuys.com AT ALL. If you would like me to take down this API let me know.*
